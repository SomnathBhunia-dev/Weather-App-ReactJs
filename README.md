## My Built Process


Hi everyone! I am a React.Js learner and this is my 2nd project at learning stage. I just practicing the way how can developer build small/big project using React.js , JavaScript, Html & CSS framework.

In this project, I decided to create a News app where User can choose  different categories, such as world, business, sports, entertainment, Technology etc.. I used the Bing News Search API to fetch the weather data and React-Router to navigate between different pages. I also used some custom hooks and components to make the code more reusable and maintainable.

This project was a great way to learn more about React.js and how to use APIs, hooks, and routing. I enjoyed working on this project and I think it turned out pretty well. You can check out the live demo here: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘Š [Daily News App](https://reactjs.org/)

If anyone have any suggestion or correction plz feel free to give a pull request . We can improve this app as much as beautiful and workable in future . Thank you for reading and happy coding!
